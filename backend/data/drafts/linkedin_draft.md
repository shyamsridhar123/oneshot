**Hook**
Most enterprise AI initiatives don’t fail at the model layer.
They fail at the *systems layer*.

**Body**
In production, AI has to behave like any other critical enterprise component: observable, governable, and resilient under load.

At NotContosso, we focus on production-grade architecture:
• API-first, model-agnostic design to avoid vendor lock-in
• RAG pipelines backed by governed data sources and vector databases
• LLMOps for prompt/version control, evaluation, and rollback
• Human-in-the-loop workflows with policy-based overrides
• End-to-end observability across latency, cost, and output quality

Industry benchmarks show RAG-based systems can reduce hallucinations by **30–60%**, but only when paired with strong data governance and monitoring.

That’s why enterprise AI isn’t a demo problem—it’s a distributed systems problem.
