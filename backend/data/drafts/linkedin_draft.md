🤝 **Work is collaborative. Your AI should be too.**

Most teams don’t struggle because of a lack of tools.
They struggle because their tools don’t work *together*.

Today, we’re excited to introduce **NotContosso’s new AI collaboration tool** — designed to bring shared intelligence directly into the workflows where real work happens.

As enterprise AI investment accelerates toward **$200B globally by 2026**, the shift is clear: value comes from AI embedded into everyday collaboration, not isolated features. Our new tool helps teams:

• Collaborate with AI in real time, across roles and projects  
• Reduce friction by sharing context automatically  
• Turn conversations into decisions — and decisions into action

This isn’t AI that replaces people.
It’s **AI that works with your team**, adapting to how you communicate, align, and deliver results.

We believe collaboration should accelerate innovation — not slow it down. This launch is one more step toward making enterprise AI simpler, more human, and more effective.

👉 **Explore how intelligent collaboration can transform the way your teams work.**
