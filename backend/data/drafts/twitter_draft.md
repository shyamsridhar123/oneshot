AI tools shouldn’t work in isolation—and neither should teams.

Today, we’re launching the **NotContosso AI Collaboration Suite**. 🧵👇

1/ One shared AI across meetings, docs, and workflows—so teams operate from the same context.

2/ Built for enterprise scale: security, governance, and control by design.

3/ Early teams saw **40% fewer meetings** and **3× faster documentation** by aligning decisions in real time.

4/ AI shouldn’t just help individuals.
It should help teams move together.

What’s the biggest collaboration challenge your team faces today?
