1/ Enterprise AI has crossed a line.
It’s no longer about experimentation—it’s about **trust, ROI, and scale**.

2/ Enterprise AI investment is projected to hit **$200B by 2026**.
The winners won’t be the loudest. They’ll be the most credible.

3/ What’s driving engagement right now?
→ AI collaboration & multi‑agent systems
→ Clear ROI in digital transformation
→ Human + AI workflows (not hype)

4/ We’re seeing higher engagement when companies share:
• Technical depth
• Real use cases
• Lessons learned (not just launches)

5/ Another gap: responsible AI.
Buyers are actively looking for brands with a clear POV on ethics, transparency, and governance.

6/ This is where companies like **Test Corporation** can stand out—by pairing engineering rigor with human context.

7/ The future of enterprise tech belongs to builders who explain *how* things work—and *why* they matter.
