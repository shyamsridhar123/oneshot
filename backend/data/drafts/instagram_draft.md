AI shouldn’t just assist—it should collaborate. 🤝🤖

Today, we’re launching the **NotContosso AI Collaboration Suite**, built for enterprise teams that work across meetings, documents, and workflows.

Most teams don’t struggle with effort.
They struggle with fragmented context.

The AI Collaboration Suite brings:
✅ One shared AI teammate
✅ Cross-team understanding
✅ Enterprise-grade security and control

In early deployments, teams cut meetings by **40%** and moved from discussion to decision faster—together.

This is AI that works *with* your team.
