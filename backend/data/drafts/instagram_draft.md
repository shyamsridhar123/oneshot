**Opening Line**
🧠 Enterprise AI isn’t magic—it’s systems engineering.

**Body**
Behind every reliable AI feature is a stack most people never see:

• Governed data pipelines feeding RAG systems
• Vector databases for low-latency retrieval
• Workflow orchestration and policy enforcement
• Human-in-the-loop review and override controls
• Observability across cost, latency, and model drift

That’s how AI earns trust in production environments—where compliance, uptime, and collaboration matter as much as accuracy.

**CTA**
Save this if you care about *how* AI actually works in the enterprise. Share it with someone building production GenAI.
