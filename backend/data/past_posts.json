AI automates workflows → humans focus on strategy\n\nThe companies winning with AI aren't replacing their teams.

Clinician workflows that can't be interrupted.\n\nBut here's what we learned:\n\n✅ Start with the workflow, not the technology\n✅ Compliance isn't a blocker — it's a design constraint\n✅ Clinicians don't want AI tools — they want fewer clicks\n\nThe result: 45% reduction in clinical documentation time. Zero compliance incidents.\n\nHealthcare AI isn't about replacing doctors. It's about giving them more time to be doctors.\n\nWe're hiring healthcare AI specialists.

Hiring people who understand the DOMAIN is the real moat.\n\nOur best product decisions came from team members who worked in the industries we serve.\n\n3/ AI demos are easy. AI in production is brutal.\n\nLatency, edge cases, hallucinations, scale — the gap between demo and production is where most AI startups die.\n\n4/ Enterprise sales cycles are long, but enterprise retention is forever.\n\nOur first enterprise customer is still our biggest champion 3 years later.\n\n5/ The most important metric isn't accuracy — it's adoption.\n\nA 95% accurate model that nobody uses is worth less than an 85% accurate model embedded in the workflow.\n\nWhat would you add? 👇\n\n#NotContosso #AI #BuildInPublic #Startups",
